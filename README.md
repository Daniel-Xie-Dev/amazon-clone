## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/amazon-clone-screenshot.PNG)

Amazon has been my go-to e-commerce site for as long as I can remember. It played a crucial role during my high school years and continued to be a reliable companion throughout my college journey. As a software engineer, I wanted to put my skills to the test and challenge myself by creating a project similar to Amazon.

This project encompasses a range of features, including:
+ Sign in and sign up: A user-friendly system that allows you to easily create an account or log in to access all the features.
+ Secure authorization: Contains authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can make transactions
+ Shopping cart convenience: A smooth and intuitive shopping cart experience that lets you view and manage your selected items effortlessly.
+ Add or remove with ease: Whether you're adding items to your cart or deciding to remove them, it's all just a few clicks away. 
+ Track your orders: Keep tabs on your previous orders with the convenience of order history.
+ Share your thoughts: Want to give feedback or share your experience with a product? A rating and commenting feature is included, so you can let others know what you think.
+ Find what you need: Looking for something specific? Simply use the search bar to find the products you're after quickly. It's designed to make your shopping experience efficient and enjoyable.
